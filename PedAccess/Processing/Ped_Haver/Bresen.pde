NOTE: This code may still be condensed 
  
The bresenham algorithm is a classic algorithm used in early computer graphics. It renders a line on rasterized (gridded) space. 
The algorithm takes in a start and end point and finds all the points between them at the scale that the user sets. 

This implementation takes in a csv with a series of points. I arranged them into seperate lines, each with a unique id. 
If you want to use the code exactly, name your columns "shapeid" for the line id number, "x" for your x coordinate and "y" for your y coordinate

I chose to draw a grid of ellipses, becuase I use this alogirthm in a path finding network over pedestrian paths and ellipses are easier for visual confirmation, but you can use squares

//lines should have an ID, I call it "shapeid" because this matches most GeoSpatial data structures from programs like QGIS 

//set a scale for your grid; this is the weight of each raster cell
float scale;
 
//global variables for rendering lines
