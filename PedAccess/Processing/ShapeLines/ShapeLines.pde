This script renders layers of shapefile data by drawing out the linestrings (or polygons) from a lat lon to an xy grid

The aspect ratio here is 22.0(width units): 18.0 (length units) but this is fairly arbitrary. This aspect ratio is the usual aspect ratio for a CityScope Pixilized Grid. 

This is Singapore shapefile data, but it can work with any. 

This uses the Haversine formula to project lat lon coordinates to an XY Cartesian grid. 


/////BUGS 

1. Please note there is a bug in the Haversine calculation going from Center. It goes perfectly from left corner though. 
2. There are also ghost lines from the shape file on the perimeter. I may need to add another filter.


////To Do 
1. Clean code and think about how classes are constructed
